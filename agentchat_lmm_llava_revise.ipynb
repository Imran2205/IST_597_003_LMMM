In addition to the bounding box, the 3D \\n        coordinates of the object (3d_cord), estimated from the depth map, are provided for each object. \\n        These coordinates are in the format [x, y, z], where \"z\" represents the distance of the \\n        object from the camera. The origin of the point cloud, used to derive the 3D coordinates, \\n        coincides with the camera\\'s location in each frame. Based on this spatial information, \\n        provide a detailed description of the events occurring within the video\\'s 10 frames, \\n        including scene composition and the relationships between objects (e.g., if two objects move closer \\n        together or farther apart).
